## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework. You can also check out [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Habit & Task Tracker API

A full-stack portfolio project focused on building a clean, scalable REST API to support a future mobile application.

This project implements a Laravel-based backend with a MySQL database, designed to be consumed by a Flutter mobile client. The goal is to demonstrate solid backend architecture, RESTful design principles, and real-world data modeling for productivity applications.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Backend: Laravel (PHP)

Database: MySQL

API: RESTful JSON API

Auth (planned): Laravel Sanctum

Client (planned): Flutter mobile app

## 🧠 Core Concepts & Design Decisions

Tasks act as their own log using timestamps (created_at, updated_at).

Habits use a dedicated habit_logs table to track daily completion.

Relational database design with foreign keys and cascade deletes.

API-first architecture, no server-rendered views.

Designed with mobile consumption and scalability in mind.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

users — application users

tasks — one-off or general tasks

habits — recurring habits

habit_logs — daily habit completion records

## 📡 API Features (In Progress)

CRUD operations for tasks and habits

Habit completion tracking per day

JSON responses following REST conventions

Authentication via Laravel Sanctum (planned)

## 🔮 Roadmap

Implement authentication (Sanctum)

Secure API endpoints per user

Add validation & API resources

Connect Flutter mobile client

Add analytics (habit streaks, completion stats)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is part of a personal developer portfolio, showcasing:

Backend architecture skills

REST API design

Database modeling

Preparation for real mobile app integration
